<h1>GAB LAB 2019 Local Instance Script</h1>

Quick (and dirty) PowerShell script to spin up instances of the 2019 Science Lab on your local machine (requires Docker)

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

1.	Download ‘GAB2019 Docker Local Script.ps1’
2.	Open the file in an editor and modify any of the $environmentVariables values to match your needs.
3.	This has a default of 10 instances, change the $numberOfInstances variable if you want more/fewer.
4.	This will, by default, start at port 8080 and increase port number by one for each of the $numberOfInstances.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

You need Docker installed for this to work.
